                            <p>The 23rd of May was a special day for us, as we attended our first Laracon in Madrid. We've been using Laravel since 2014 (version 4.2), and since it is part of our main <a href="{{ localizedRoute('tech-stack') }}">tech stack</a> and we're also trying to take active part in the local community, Laracon has always been high up on our conferences bucket list, but it just didn't work out for us until now.</p>
                            <p>We arrived early on the 22nd, and after a long walk exploring Madrid and some awesome paella, we dropped by Teatros Luchana for an evening of networking, drinks and tapas, sponsored by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cyberduck_uk" target="_blank">Cyber Duck</a>. It was great to meet new people who think alike and are all excited about Laravel, the same way we are.</p>

                            <p>The actual conference kicked off the next morning. After a quick breakfast and some more mingling, <a href="https://twitter.com/freekmurze" target="_blank"><strong>Freek Van der Herten</strong></a> started the talks with his piece called "Supercharging Common Controllers". After going through some of best practices to keep your code clean, Freek presented some (more) awesome packages they developed at <a href="https://spatie.be" target="_blank">Spatie</a>. Their work in the Laravel open-source space is quite unparalelled and it was nice to talk to them during the breaks.</p>

                            <p class="has-margin-t60">We've been to a couple of conferences before, and there's always some talks that are just sub-par, but I can honestly say, it wasn't the case here. The quality of the speakers was excellent, all-round.</p>
                            <p>The venue was also really cool. An awesome movie theatre with a funky industrial design interior. It wasn't big, but it's coziness really added to the friendly atmosphere. The tapas was also great, in fact each meal in Madrid was mouth-watering. I guess that's one of the perks of being in Spain.</p>
                            <p>Best of all was the community. Everybody was really open-minded, talkative and just good people to hang out with. We made some new friends and found out a lot about the communities and projects around Europe. We can't wait to see them again. One thing's for sure: we'll definitely be back next year (we actually got our tickets this morning!)</p>
